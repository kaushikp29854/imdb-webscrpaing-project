# imdb-webscrpaing-project

Created a project that scrapes off the imdb page to help users select a movie/tv show to watch. Essentially, a user enters a actor/actress, genre, and a minimum tv show rating. The code will return to you a list of movies to choose from as well as thier genre, rating and other co-stars.
